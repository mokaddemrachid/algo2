this repository contains two files.
file1 : algorithm of the problem number 1 which is an algorithm for calculating the sum of all the elements of the 2 arrays
and present only in one of the arrays.
file2: algorithm of problem number 2 which determines,
for n pairs of given vectors, whether two vectors are orthogonal, using two solutions (function/procedure).
